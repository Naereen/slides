### Your mission, if you accept it... :boom:
- *Padawan level:* Train yourself a little bit on Python $\longrightarrow$ XXX
- *Jedi level:* Try to solve a numerical system, from your research or teaching, in Python instead of MATLAB
- *Master level:* From now on, use only open-source tools (Python and others) ??
