- *About:*  Python introduction for MATLAB users

- *Date:* $18$th of January $2018$

- *Who:* Lilian Besson

# What's a *"GouTP"* ?

- **Internal monthly technical training session** :date:
- Usually: *Thursday 3pm :clock3: - 3:30pm* :clock330:
- With :coffee: coffee and :cookie: sweets : we relax while training !

  > Initiative of Quentin and Vincent :clap: in last January...
  > Continued by Rémi and Lilian :ok_hand: !

## Not only @ SCEE ?
- Currently open to the *FAST team*
  $\hookrightarrow$ If success, next ones will be open to other research teams @ Supelec Rennes

# Agenda for today $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ ==[30 min]==

1. What is Python $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ ==[10 min]==
2. Examples of problems solved with MATLAB and Python $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ ==[15 min]==
3. Where can I find more information $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ ==[5 min]==

# What is Python
- Open-source and free programming language
- Developped and popular from the last $25$ years
- Interpreted, multi-platform, imperative and object-oriented
- Simple to learn and use
- Used worldwide: research, data science, web applications etc

# Comparison with MATLAB

|  | Python | MATLAB
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Cost | Free | Hundreds of € / year
| License | Open-source | Paid user license (no longer when you finish your PhD!)
| Developped by | A non-profit foundation, and the community | MathWorks company
| Scope | Generic | Numeric only
| Platform | Any | Desktop only

# How to install Python
- On Linux and Mac OS : already installed!
- On Windows or any other platform:
  + You can use the default installer from [python.org/downloads/windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
  + Or the full installer from [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (Free!)
- Takes about $10$ minutes... and $0$€ !

---

# How to install new packages in Python
- If you used the standard installer, use `pip install [name]` (in a terminal) to install package `[name]`,
- Or for Anaconda, use `conda install [name]`.

# To find packages?
- Ask your colleagues :smile: !
- Look on the Internet
- Look directly on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) (official) or [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org)

# Conclusion (1/3)

## Sum-up
- I hope you got a good introduction to Python
- It's not hard to migrate from MATLAB to Python
- More ressources:
  + mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html
  + and mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf (17 pages!)
  + a 45-minute training video : youtu.be/YkCegjtoHFQ
  + docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html

# Conclusion (2/3)

## Next GouTP @ SCEE
> By Lilian
- Jupyter notebooks for teaching and research
  $\hookrightarrow$ jupyter.org
- Julia programming language (~ between Python and Matlab)
  $\hookrightarrow$ julialang.org

## GouTP @ FAST or AUT ?
> By you ? Any idea is welcome!

---

# Conclusion (3/3)

> *Thanks for joining :clap: !* *Contact us if you want to do a GouTP!*

## Your mission, if you accept it... :boom:
1. *Padawan level:* Train yourself a little bit on Python :snake:
   $\hookrightarrow$ introtopython.org or learnpython.org
2. *Jedi level:* Try to solve a numerical system, from your research or teaching, in Python instead of MATLAB
3. *Master level:* From now on, try to use open-source tools for your research (Python and others) ?
