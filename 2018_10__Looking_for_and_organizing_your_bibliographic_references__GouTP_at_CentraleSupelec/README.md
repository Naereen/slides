# USRP TestBeds :phone:
- We have 8 USRP cards that can be used from GNU Radio Companion on the WS3
- See more on http://172.16.6.219/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page#Hardware

## Monitoring :mag:
- http://172.16.6.213:8000 (made by Quentin)
- let you see the IP of each USRP card
- and who uses what in real time

## :tipping_hand_woman: Advice
- If you need to use the USRP, *discuss with Nabil and Lilian before*

# 2. How to look for bibliographic references?

## :warning: Do we need references?
- Yes

## :warning: But just for the paper right?
- No: you need references *at every step* of our research job!

## :warning: How to find references?
- We will see some techniques

---

## Reading papers
- Each research paper has a list of references
- This always gives an easy way to find new references: just go read every quoted paper!

---

![bg original 95%](figures/reading_papers_for_new_references.png)

---

![bg original 95%](figures/reading_papers_for_new_references_2.png)

---

## Looking by keyword

- Try to look for some keywords, in Google Scholar, Google, DuckDuckGo, ResearchGate etc
- :warning: Some keywords will give *a lot* of results!
- Filter by language! Filter by date!
- Combine keywords!

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_by_keyword_2.png)

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_by_keyword.png)

---

## Looking by author

- If you know an author, it's easy to find his/her work
- It usually gives good references on related work!

## Example?
- For examples, with my advisor Émilie Kaufmann…

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_by_author_name_2.png)

---

## Google Scholar

- Many researchers have a Google Scholar profile
- But it is also very useful to look for new references

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_on_google_scholar.png)

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_on_google_scholar_2.png)

---

## ResearchGate

- Many researchers have a ResearchGate profile
- But it is also very useful to look for new references
- (same, just less popular than Google Scholar)

### :warning: Warning!
- :warning: they have a very aggressive copyright policy!
- Suggestion: do as Rémi:
  only upload a one-page PDF that links to the HAL version

---

![bg original 95%](figures/warning_about_researchgate_copyright_policy.png)

## How to find the PDF of a research paper ?
Once you know what to read, try this to find the paper:

1. Google Scholar / ResearchGate / Academia
2. Google / DuckDuckGo / your favorite search engine
3. The author's website! *Or directly ask them!*
4. arXiv search page (it's brand new and works perfectly well!),
5. or HAL search page
6. IEEEXplore : CentraleSupélec pays the license!
   [`ieeexplore-ieee-org.bibliopam.supelec.fr`](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.bibliopam.supelec.fr)
6. Some hacky websites (use at your own risk),
   e.g., Sci-Hub → [`WhereIsSciHub.Now.sh`](https://whereisscihub.now.sh/) ?
7. :warning: *Never pay yourself to read a research paper!* :warning:

## How to write paper and insert bibliography

- Use *LaTeX*
- Use *BibTeX* (or *BibLaTeX*)

Example (LaTeX `.tex` file and BibTeX `.bib` file):

```latex
\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}   % or alpha, or other style
\bibliography{myBibFile}     % at the end of the LaTeX file
```

```bibtex
@unpublished{SMPyBanditsHAL,
    title = {{SMPyBandits: an Experimental Framework
    for Single and Multi-Players Multi-Arms Bandits Algorithms in Python}},
    author = {Besson, Lilian},
    url = {https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01840022},
    note = {Presentation paper, at hal.inria.fr/hal-01840022},
    year = {2018},
}
```

---

## Example: In the body of the article

![bg original 95%](figures/example_of_using_bibtex_and_latex_1.png)

---

## Example: In the reference list

![bg original 95%](figures/example_of_using_bibtex_and_latex_2.png)

---

## Lazy way to organize your references

- Keep a bibtex file for each research project or paper,
- Fill it slowly and painfully everytime you think of a new reference
- Struggle a lot
- $\Longrightarrow$ avoid this lazy solution :warning:

> Lilian : I'm ashamed but I'm still at this level…

---

## Smart way to organize your references

Use a dedicated software such as

- [Zotero](www.zotero.org) $\Longrightarrow$ ask me
- [JabRef](www.jabref.org) $\Longrightarrow$ ask Hussein
- Others (see [full comparison by Munich University](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1320978/1320978.pdf))

### Why selecting this two ones
- Used by the team
- Cross-plateform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Integration with text editors
- Open source $\Longrightarrow$ free

---

# But what is this ?

## Goal
- To help you along
	- searching,
	- classifying,
	- inserting references in your papers.

## Let's go for a quick walkthrough :walking:

---

## Step 1: Download, install and setup

- Download and install from website ([Zotero](www.zotero.org), [JabRef](www.jabref.org), etc).
- Download and install browser add-on.
	- Zotero: Firefox, Chrome & Safari
	- JabRef: Firefox only
- Setup synchronization.
	- Backup your bibliography
	- Share your bibliography
- Setup CentraleSupelec proxy if you want to access IEEExplore with connector.

---

## Setup proxy to access IEEExplore

![bg original 95%](figures/setup_proxy.png)

---

## Step 2: Develop your bibliography

### On both Zotero & JabRef
- Import files from your computer
- Save pages from your web browser
	- Papers
	- Web pages
	- Wikipedia...

### On JabRef
- Search for papers on IEEExplore, arXiv, Google Scholar...

---

## Step 3: Classify your bibliography

### On both Zotero & JabRef
- Classify into collections to sort documents by topics.
- Automatic fetch of meta-data.
- Search based on author, date, conferences...
- Add notes and comments.

### On Zotero
- Add markers and use them to find articles.
- Construct a chronology.

## Zotero desktop version

---

## Zotero web version

![bg original 95%](figures/Zotero_online.png)

---

## Step 4: Add references to your documents

- Application plugins to quick reference insertions
	- JabRef: Emacs, Lyk, TeXstudio, Vim...
	- Zotero: LibreOffice, Word...

- Export a list of references as
	- *BibTex* and other *LaTeX* formats
	- IEEE style and other ordinary styles for copy & paste

---

## Export as *BibTex*

## Tips & tricks

- Save all papers that you read.
- Save also usefull web pages, newspaper articles...
	- :warning: Dont forget to add few information about the content


- A few minutes to lose now but hours to save later.
