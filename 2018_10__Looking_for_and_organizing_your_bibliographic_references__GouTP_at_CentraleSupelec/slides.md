- You will become familiar with the research themes of our team…

<br><br>

### $\hookrightarrow$ Let see a few :hammer_and_wrench: tools that can make your life easier!

- It is maintained by Karim and Majed

![35%](figures/demo_of_our_website.png#center)

## New comers, please :pray:
- send a short summary of your research interest with links to your LinkedIn, Google Scholar profile (or other sites). Picture: *if you want*
- **to Rémi and I** so we add you on the website

---

# Internal Wiki :memo:
- We have a MediaWiki running locally on http://172.16.6.219/
- Welcome pack : can be useful in your first days here!
  http://172.16.6.219/mediawiki/index.php/Welcome_to_SCEE
- Anyone can edit, it is maintained by Rémi and I
- Participate if you have anything to change (create an account, edit!)

# Workstations :computer: (Windows & GNU/Linux)

- 2 Windows 7 workstations, with MATLAB
  + WS1 : `172.16.6.211`
  + WS2 : `172.16.6.212`
- 1 GNU/Linux (Ubuntu) workstation, with Python, GNU Radio…
  + WS3 : `172.16.6.213`
- Powerful machines: 12 cores, 32 Gb of RAM, lots of storage…
- Monitoring :mag: : http://172.16.6.219:8000 (ask us for ==id/passwd==)
  (please check for use load, before launching heavy simulations)

## :tipping_hand_woman: Ask for an account if you need
- To run computations, or to use the TestBed
- Ask to *Rami for Windows*, to *Lilian for GNU/Linux*

# USRP TestBeds :phone:
- We have 8 USRP cards that can be used from GNU Radio Companion on the WS3
- See more on http://172.16.6.219/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page#Hardware

## Monitoring :mag:
- http://172.16.6.213:8000 (made by Quentin)
- let you see the IP of each USRP card
- and who uses what in real time

## :tipping_hand_woman: Advice
- If you need to use the USRP, *discuss with Nabil and Lilian before*

# 2. How to look for bibliographic references?

## :warning: Do we need references?
- Yes

## :warning: But just for the paper right?
- No: you need references *at every step* of our research job!

## :warning: How to find references?
- We will see some techniques

---

## Reading papers
- Each research paper has a list of references
- This always gives an easy way to find new references: just go read every quoted paper!

---

---

![bg original 95%](figures/reading_papers_for_new_references_2.png)

---

## Looking by keyword

- Try to look for some keywords, in Google Scholar, Google, DuckDuckGo, ResearchGate etc
- :warning: Some keywords will give *a lot* of results!
- Filter by language! Filter by date!
- Combine keywords!

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_by_keyword_2.png)

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_by_keyword.png)

---

## Looking by author

- If you know an author, it's easy to find his/her work
- It usually gives good references on related work!

## Example?
- For examples, with my advisor Émilie Kaufmann…

---

## Google Scholar

- Many researchers have a Google Scholar profile
- But it is also very useful to look for new references

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_on_google_scholar.png)

---

![bg original 95%](figures/looking_for_on_google_scholar_2.png)

---

## ResearchGate

- Many researchers have a Google Scholar profile
- But it is also very useful to look for new references
- (same, just less popular than Google Scholar)

### :warning: Warning!
- :warning: they have a very aggressive copyright policy!
- Suggestion: do as Rémi:
  only upload a one-page PDF that links to the HAL version

---

## How to find the PDF of a research paper ?
Once you know what to read, try this to find the paper:

1. Google Scholar / ResearchGate / Academia
2. Google / DuckDuckGo / your favorite search engine
3. The author's website! Or directly ask them!
4. arXiv search page (it's brand new and works perfectly well!)
5. IEEEXplore : CentraleSupélec pays the license!
   [`ieeexplore-ieee-org.bibliopam.supelec.fr`](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.bibliopam.supelec.fr)
6. Some hacky websites (use at your own risk),
   e.g., Sci-Hub → [`WhereIsSciHub.Now.sh`](https://whereisscihub.now.sh/) ?
7. :warning: *Never pay yourself to read a research paper!* :warning:

# 3. How to organize your references: JabRef & Zotero

> By Bastien

---

## How to write paper and insert bibliography

- Use *LaTeX*
- Use *BibTeX* (or *BibLaTeX*)

Example (LaTeX `.tex` file and BibTeX `.bib` file):

```latex
\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}
\bibliography{myBibFile}     % at the end of the LaTeX file
```

```bibtex
@unpublished{SMPyBanditsHAL,
    title = {{SMPyBandits: an Experimental Framework
    for Single and Multi-Players Multi-Arms Bandits Algorithms in Python}},
    author = {Besson, Lilian},
    url = {https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01840022},
    note = {Presentation paper, at hal.inria.fr/hal-01840022},
    year = {2018},
}
```

---

## Lazy way to organize your references

- Keep a bibtex file for each research project or paper,
- Fill it slowly and painfully everytime you think of a new reference
- Struggle a lot
- $\Longrightarrow$ avoid this lazy solution :warning:

> Lilian : I'm ashamed but I'm still at this level…

# Conclusion (1/3)

## Sum-up
- We showed you techniques to look for new references,
  and to find and download the PDF (*legally*)
- We showed you two softwares to manage your bibliography

## Pointers

# Conclusion (3/3)

> <span class="fontify">Thanks for joining :clap: !</span>
> <span class="fontify">Contact us if you want to do a GouTP !</span>

## Your mission, if you accept it… :boom:
1. *Padawan level :* be smart about how you look for new references.
2. *Jedi level :* organize and backup your references and BibTeX files!
3. *Master level :* publish so many papers that your name will be in the BibTeX files of half the planet (*yes we can!*).
