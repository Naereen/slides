<br><br>

### Not only @ SCEE 😃 ?
- Currently open to the *FAST* and *AUT* teams

---

## Agenda for today ⏲ [30 min]

1. Quick presentation of internal tools @ SCEE [5 min]
2. What are the Jupyter notebook tools ? [10 min]
3. Demo time [10 min]
4. Sharing your notebooks online or as PDF [5 min]

<br>

### Please 🙏
Ask questions and interrupt me if you want!

## 1. Presentation of internal tools @ SCEE

- Welcome to our new PhD student and interns 🖐 !
- You met (almost) everybody this week !
- You will become familiar with the research themes of our team…

<br><br>

#### $\hookrightarrow$ Let see a few 🛠 tools that can make your life easier!

---

## Website 🕸
- [www-scee.rennes.supelec.fr](http://www-scee.rennes.supelec.fr/) was created by Rémi and Aymeric
- It is maintained mainly by Rémi : we need help!

<img src="figures/demo_of_our_website.png" width="45%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;">

### New comers, please 🙏
- send a short summary of your research interest with links to your LinkedIn, Google Scholar profile (or other sites). Picture: *if you want*
- **to Rémi and I** so we add you on the website

---

## Internal Wiki 📝
- We have a MediaWiki running locally on http://172.16.6.219/
- Welcome pack : can be useful in your first days here!
  http://172.16.6.219/mediawiki/index.php/Welcome_to_SCEE
- Anyone can edit, it is maintained by Rémi and I
- Participate if you have anything to change (create an account, edit!)

<img src="figures/demo_of_our_wiki.png" width="40%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;">

## Workstations 💻 (Windows & GNU/Linux)

- 2 Windows 7 workstations, with MATLAB
  + WS1 : `172.16.6.211`
  + WS2 : `172.16.6.212`
- 1 GNU/Linux (Ubuntu) workstation, with Python, GNU Radio…
  + WS3 : `172.16.6.213`
- Powerful machines: 12 cores, 32 Gb of RAM, lots of storage…
- Monitoring 🔍 : http://172.16.6.219:8000 (ask us for id/passwd)
  (please check for use load, before launching heavy simulations)

### Ask for an account if you need
- To run computations, or to use the TestBed
- Ask to *Muhammad for Windows*, to *me for GNU/Linux*

---

---

## USRP TestBeds ☎
- We have 8 USRP cards that can be used from GNU Radio Companion on the WS3
- See more on http://172.16.6.219/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page#Hardware

### Monitoring 🔍
- http://172.16.6.213:8000 (made by Quentin)
- let you see the IP of each USRP card
- and who uses what in real time

### Advice
- If you need to use the USRP, *discuss with Rémi and Lilian before*

## 2. "Project Jupyter", jupyter.org

<img src="figures/logo.png" width="105%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;">

---

## 2. What are Jupyter notebooks?

### Technical aspect 🔍
1. A file format, `.ipynb`  (just JSON with constraints)
2. An editor in your browser (see it during demo time)
3. Tools to convert `.ipynb` files to scripts, HTML, slides, PDF etc.

### Practical aspect 🚀
4. A very good way to interact with your code
5. Create smart document with text, maths, code, output and figures, **all included in one file**
6. Easy and perfect to share online and with colleagues !

---

## How to learn 🎓 ?

### Online 🕸
- Try without installing anything ? $\longrightarrow$ At [try.jupyter.org](https://try.jupyter.org/)

### On your laptop 💻
1. Install it 📦
2. Then start:
   ```bash
   # from your console
   $ jupyter notebook
   ```

---

3. Then experiment, practice and learn

> If you installed Python with Anaconda, it should be in your system menu *by default* (along *Spyder*, *IPython* and *IPython QT Console*)…


---

### How to install it 📦 ?

Install it (you need 🐍 Python) from https://jupyter.org/install.html.

```bash
$ conda install jupyter  # if you use Anaconda/conda
$ pip install jupyter    # for the system-wide Python & pip
```

### How to start it ?
```sh
$ jupyter notebook # from your console
...
Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect
for the first time, to login with a token:
http://localhost:8888/?token=44450caacdbe3ecddc21e02e66a6b5162cdd2d86dccd5264
```

- It should open http://localhost:8888/notebooks/ in your browser
- Or open the link in your terminal

---

## 🐍 Only for Python 😢 ??
- No: supports naitively Julia, Python and R (**Ju + Py + R = Jupyter**)
- Dozens of "kernels" allow you to use Jupyter with *almost* any language ! (for free). Installation is usually simple & fast.

### Partial list 📝
- Interpreted languages: 🐚 Bash, 🐫 Caml/OCaml, Lua etc
- 😃 and of course Wolfram Mathematica and MATLAB
  > even if they have their own notebook tools now.
- 😮 But also compiled languages : C++, C, Go, Java !

---

### Complete list of "kernels"
> See [github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)

---

## 3. Demo time

- I will show you quickly all this…

- With an example of coding in Python.

- Reference documentation is:
  [jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html)

---

### [Internally](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/visual_overview.html), it's quite complicated, just don't care

<img src="figures/repos_map.png" width="55%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;">

---

## Conclusion (1/3)

### Sum-up
- I hope you got a good introduction to Jupyter 👌
  + Official documentation: at [jupyter.rtfd.io](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html)
- Also [datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook](http://datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)

### Pointers
1. ❤ use it and fall in love with it !

2. Use Jupyter-themes ([`github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes`](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes))
  to customize the UI as you wish (dark themes, custom fonts etc)
3. Use extensions if you want more features,
  See [jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.rtfd.io](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io)

---

## Conclusion (2/3)

### Next GouTP @ SCEE
- Any request or suggestion ?

### GouTP @ FAST or AUT ?
> By Pierre Haessig ?

- **Julia programming language** (~ between Python and Matlab)
  $\hookrightarrow$ see julialang.org if you are curious

### We need participants!
> 👉 By *you*? Any idea is welcome! 😃

---

## Conclusion (3/3)

> *Thanks for joining 👏 !*
> *Contact us if you want to do a GouTP !*

<br>

### Your mission, if you accept it… 💥
1. *Padawan level :* next time you program in 🐍 Python (or other language), think about **Jyputer**. Can it help you being more efficient?
2. *Jedi level :* Try to use **Jupyter** when you will have to share or show some piece of code?
3. *Master level :* From now on, try to use (only?) open-source tools for your research (Python and others)…
