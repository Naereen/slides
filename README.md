# [remark.js slideshow](https://github.com/gnab/remark) :notebook: by [Naereen @ GitHub](https://naereen.github.io/)

This repository hosts some [remark.js slideshows](https://github.com/gnab/remark), covering various subjects.

- This repository is only here to host some small experiments, for me to learn how to use [the remark.js slideshow tools](http://remarkjs.com/) correctly;
- But more interesting slideshows will/might come... soon!

## *How to read these documents*?

### 1. On [naereen.github.io/slides](http://naereen.github.io/slides/)
- [template](http://naereen.github.io/slides/template/)
- [2016_07__Python_demo_at_EPFL](http://naereen.github.io/slides/2016_07__Python_demo_at_EPFL/). For these slides, you can also [read this list of links](2016_07__Python_demo_at_EPFL/links.md).
- More will come soon!

### :arrow_forward: 2. View the slides on-line ?
> Thanks to [rawgit.com](https://rawgit.com/):

- Example: [template](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Naereen/slides/master/template/)
- Use this URL: `https://cdn.rawgit.com/Naereen/slides/master/NAME_OF_THE_SLIDE/`

> Thanks to [remarkjs.com/remarkise](http://remarkjs.com/remarkise):

- Example: [2016_07__Python_demo_at_EPFL/slides.md](http://remarkjs.com/remarkise?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FNaereen%2Fslides%2Fmaster%2F2016_07__Python_demo_at_EPFL%2Fslides.md#3)

### :arrows_counterclockwise: 3. View the slides locally ?
- You can also clone this repository, and browse locally the slides.
- For some slides, they are not working as independant HTML files, so I switched to [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md): simply use `make` in the sub-folder and it will open the slides in a browser (the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reveal-md) package `reveal-md` is required, though...)
