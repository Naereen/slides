To everyone interested about Python, here are a few links:


## Installing Python
- Recommended way: with Anaconda (any platform), see https://www.continuum.io/downloads

## Learning Python
1. Basic tutorial: http://introtopython.org/
2. More advanced topics: http://www.scipy-lectures.org/

## Python for (basic) Image Processing
- Warning: don't expect a nice tool like ImageJ
- scipy.ndimage, Cf. the tutorial http://www.scipy-lectures.org/advanced/image_processing/index.html
- scikit-image, http://scikit-image.org

## Machine Learning in Python :
- scikit-learn, http://scikit-learn.org
- Other packages: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning#python

## Plotting and Data Visualization in Python
- matplotlib for 2D/3D plots, basic but standard, MATLAB-like interface, http://matplotlib.org/
- Other package: http://vispy.org/, http://www.pyqtgraph.org/, http://awesome-python.com/#data-visualization ...

## Deep Learning in Python
- tensorflow and tflearn, http://www.tensorflow.org/ http://tflearn.org/#quick-overview (see with Thibault ?)
- caffe and its Python interface, http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/ (see with Anais ?)
- theano and lasagne, http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/
- keras uses either Theano or TensorFlow, on the CPU or GPU, in a nice pure Python interface, http://keras.io/
- More ideas: https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning#frameworks ...

Choose wisely your preferred package...
Maybe discuss with others in the lab, and try to choose a common package suiting your needs.
You will be able to get help from colleagues if everyone has the same framework.

## IDEs for Python (http://awesome-python.com/#ides)
- For Daniel and others Eclipse fans, there is the PyDev plugin: http://www.pydev.org/ (also for LiClipse, http://www.liclipse.com/)
- Spyder is nice too: https://pythonhosted.org/spyder
- Emacs, vim, SublimeText etc all have a Python mode or plugin (http://awesome-python.com/#editor-plugins)
- Jupyter notebook might be interesting too: http://jupyter.org/

## Tools to write good Python scripts
- Static analysis, the best one is pylint, cf. http://awesome-python.com/#code-analysis-and-linter
- There is time/memory profilers, cf. http://awesome-python.com/#debugging-tools


To answer Daniel's questions:
- There is tools to distribute a Python like a .jar Java archive: http://awesome-python.com/#build-tools
- Traits is the main package to build small interactive dialogs: http://www.scipy-lectures.org/packages/traits/index.html


Happy Pythoning.
