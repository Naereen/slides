### Please :pray:
Ask questions *at the end* if you want!

# 1. Motivations

- IoT networks are interesting and will be more and more present,
- More and more IoT objects
- $\Longrightarrow$ networks will be more and more occupied

But...

- Heterogeneous spectrum occupancy in most IoT networks standards
- Maybe IoT objects can improve their communication by *learning* to access the network more efficiently (e.g., by using the less occupied spectrum channel)
- Simple but efficient learning algorithm can give great improvements in terms of successful communication rates
- $\Longrightarrow$ can fit more objects in the existing IoT networks :tada: !

---

# 2. System Model

Wireless network
- In ISM band, centered at $433.5$ MHz (in Europe)
- $K=4$ (or more) orthogonal channels

Gateway
- One gateway, handling different objects
- Communications with ALOHA protocol (without retransmission)
- Objects send data for $1$s in one channel, wait for an *acknowledgement* for $1$s in same channel, use Ack as feedback: success / failure
- Each object: communicate from time to time (e.g., every $10$ s)
- Goal: maximize successful communications $\Longleftrightarrow$ maximize sum of received Ack

# 2. System Model

---

# Hypotheses

1. We focus on **one gateway**

2. Different IoT objects using the same standard are able to run a low-cost learning algorithm on their embedded CPU

3. The spectrum occupancy generated by the rest of the environment is **assumed to be stationary**

4. And **non uniform traffic**: some channels are more occupied than others.

# 3. Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)

## 3.1. Model

## 3.2. Algorithms

---

# 3.1. Multi-Armed Bandits Model
- $K \geq 2$ resources (*e.g.*, channels), called **arms**
- Each time slot $t=1,\ldots,T$, you must choose one arm, denoted $A(t)\in\{1,\ldots,K\}$
- You receive some reward $r(t) \sim \nu_k$ when playing $k = A(t)$
- **Goal:** maximize your sum reward $\sum\limits_{t=1}^{T} r(t)$, or expected $\sum\limits_{t=1}^{T} \mathbb{E}[r(t)]$
- Hypothesis: rewards are stochastic, of mean $\mu_k$.
  Example: Bernoulli distributions.

## Why is it famous?
Simple but good model for **exploration/exploitation** dilemma.

---

# 3.2. Multi-Armed Bandits Algorithms
### Often "*index* based"
- Keep *index* $I_k(t) \in \mathbb{R}$ for each arm $k=1,\ldots,K$
- Always play $A(t) = \arg\max I_k(t)$
- $I_k(t)$ should represent our belief of the *quality* of arm $k$ at time $t$

### Example: "Follow the Leader"
- $X_k(t) := \sum\limits_{s < t} r(s) \bold{1}(A(s)=k)$ sum reward from arm $k$
- $N_k(t) := \sum\limits_{s < t} \bold{1}(A(s)=k)$ number of samples of arm $k$
- And use $I_k(t) = \hat{\mu}_k(t) := \frac{X_k(t)}{N_k(t)}$.

---

## *Upper Confidence Bounds* algorithm (UCB)
- Instead of using $I_k(t) = \frac{X_k(t)}{N_k(t)}$, add an *exploration term*
$$ I_k(t) = \frac{X_k(t)}{N_k(t)} + \sqrt{\frac{\alpha \log(t)}{2 N_k(t)}} $$

### Parameter $\alpha$: tradeoff exploration *vs* exploitation
- Small $\alpha$: focus more on **exploitation**,
- Large $\alpha$: focus more on **exploration**,
- Typically $\alpha=1$ works fine empirically and theoretically.

# 6. Future works

- Study a real IoT LPWAN protocol (e.g., LoRa)
- Implement our proposed approach in a large scale realistic

### We are exploring these directions:
- Extending the model for ALOHA-like retransmissions
